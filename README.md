# University of California San Diego's Algorithmic Toolbox
### This repository contains all the solutions to [University of California San Diego's Algorithmic Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox) course. 


### About this course

##### The course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming. We will learn a lot of theory: how to sort data and how it helps for searching; how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively; when it makes sense to proceed greedily; how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies. You will practice solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently (so that they run in less than a second).
